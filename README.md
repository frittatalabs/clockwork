# Clockwork

Clockwork is a composable flow engine for Clojure â€” built to orchestrate effectful logic with precision, elegance, and delight.

It provides a protocol-driven runtime for modeling asynchronous, stateful, and branching workflows using fluent abstractions. Whether you're building pipelines, interpreters, or reactive systems, Clockwork helps you express control flow as a series of gears that mesh cleanly and predictably.

## Features

- Composable units of logic ("gears") with clear boundaries and semantics
- Protocol-based runtime for extensibility and performance
- Zip-style comprehension for stream flow modeling (like `for` but for infinite lists)
- Built-in support for testing, tracing, and introspection

## Examples
Coming soon - maybe tomorrow?
